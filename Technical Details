Algorithm: The game uses the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to evaluate the best moves for the AI. 
It simulates all possible future moves and assigns scores to the resulting positions. The AI maximizes its score 
while minimizing the opponent's score.

Evaluation Function: The material count (based on the piece values) is used to evaluate each game state, 
though a more sophisticated evaluation function could be implemented in the future, considering piece positioning 
and other factors.

Game State Management: The board state is tracked in a 2D list, with each piece represented as an object 
containing its color and type. The board is updated after each move, and the game checks for win/loss conditions 
after every turn.
