Starting the Game:

When the game starts, the board will be printed with the initial setup.
You will be prompted to make your move, either as White or Black.
Making Moves:

Enter moves in the format of "e2 to e4" or "a7 to a5" to move pieces.
The game will check if the move is valid according to the rules of chess and update the board.
AI Move:

After you make your move, the AI will take its turn automatically.
The AI selects its move using a strategy that attempts to maximize its chances of winning.
Winning the Game:

If your King is checkmated, you lose the game.
If the AI's King is checkmated, you win the game.
If there are no legal moves left and neither player's King is in check, the game is a stalemate (draw).
